					Hi, I'm Shar! 👋🏻 Short for Sharlene. Sharstar is a nickname that came about when I was a kid and it has stuck around since then. 
					<br>
					In 2019, I graduated with a Bachelor of Computing from the University of Guelph (go gryphons!! 💛). Shortly after graduating, I managed agile documentation requirements for software development projects and streamlined project management processes at a tech company, before moving on to working as a Front End Web Developer there 👩🏻‍💻 I did this for 4 years and then decided it was time to do something new. Now I am taking some time to myself and looking for a full-time position that will give me a better work-life balance 😌
					<br><br>
					Outside work, I like to:
					<ul>
						<li>Go to fitness classes (big fan of barre, HIIT, strength training, and mat pilates)</li>
						<li>Read books (rom coms, memoirs, and the occassional thriller)</li>
						<li>Longboard, bike, and hike</li>
						<li>Crochet</li>
						<li>Learn more about web development</li>
						<li>Spend time with my friends and family</li>
					</ul>
