				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>
					<br>
					Hi, I'm Shar! Short for Sharlene. Sharstar is a fun nickname that came about when I was a kid and it just stuck around since then. 
					<br>
					In 2019, I graduated with a Bachelor of Computing from the University of Guelph (go gryphons!!) and now I'm a full-time Front End Web Developer at OHS Global. 
					<br><br>
					When I'm not at work, I like to:
					<ul>
						<li>Go to fitness classes</li>
						<li>Read books</li>
						<li>Longboard, bike, and hike</li>
						<li>Crochet</li>
						<li>Learn more about web development</li>
						<li>Spend time with my friends and family</li>
					</ul>
					Thanks for stopping by!
